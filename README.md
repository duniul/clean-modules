> Clean up/prune unnecessary files and reduce the size of your `node_modules` directory. Useful for
> CI caches or for reducing the size of your AWS Lambdas/Azure Functions.

Look, it's yet another `node_modules` cleaning tool! There are lots of these around, but I still
found the need to write my own. See the [Alternatives](#alternatives) section for more details.

This CLI tool combines the features that I could not find in other tools:

- üßπ Removes directories and files that are unnecessary and **safe to remove in production**
- üõ† Easily customizable through glob patterns (either through [CLI args](#---include----i-) or a
  [configuration file](#glob-patterns-and-configuration-file))
- üìÅ Cleans up empty directories after removing files
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Super fast, but still written in Node
- üîç Allows analyzing results, like which pattern excluded which file

## Installation

`clean-modules` can be installed globally if you only want to use it as a CLI tool. You can also
install it locally if you want to use it in a package command.

```bash
# npm
npm install -g clean-modules

# yarn
yarn global add clean-modules
```

## Quick start

Simply run the command in the directory where your `node_modules` are:

```bash
clean-modules
```

You can also pass any options that you need, like custom globs or a path to a specific
`node_modules` directory.

```bash
clean-modules --directory "path/to/node_modules" --include "*.d.ts"
```

Check out the [Options](#options) section to see all available options.

## Commands

### `clean-modules` üßπ

The default command, cleans up your `node_modules` based on a set of _most likely_ safe glob
patterns and removes empty directories.

#### Usage

```bash
clean-modules [options]
```

#### Options

#### `--include | -i`

`string | string[]`

Accepts a glob string of files/folders to include that are not included by default. Can be added
multiple times or passed multiple strings.

See the [glob patterns](#glob-patterns-and-configuration-file) section for info on how the globs are
parsed and what globs are included by default.

**Example**:

```bash
# includes all TypeScript declaration files and @types folders
clean-modules --include "**/*.d.ts" --include "**/@types/**"
# or
clean-modules --include "**/*.d.ts" "**/@types/**"
```

#### `--exclude | -e`

`string | string[]`

Accepts a glob string of files/folders to exclude from the list of included files. Excludes files
included by both `--include` option and by default. Can be added multiple times or passed multiple
strings.

See the [glob patterns](#glob-patterns-and-configuration-file) section for info on how the globs are
parsed and what globs are included by default.

**Example**:

```bash
# excludes all sourcemap files and PNG files
clean-modules --exclude "**/*.map.js" --exclude "**/*.png"
# or
clean-modules --exclude "**/*.map.js" "**/*.png"
```

#### `--directory | -D`

`string` [default: `./node_modules`]

Accepts a path to a directory to run the script on.

**Example**:

```bash
clean-modules --directory "path/to/custom/node_modules"
```

#### `--glob-file | -f`

`string` [default: `./.cleanmodules`]

Accepts a path to a file from which clean-modules should read any custom globs. See the
[glob patterns](#glob-patterns-and-configuration-file) section for information about how the glob
file works and what patterns work.

#### `--no-defaults | -n`

`boolean`

Excludes all default globs, using only custom globs added through the
[glob file](#glob-patterns-and-configuration-file) or by the include or exclude options. Useful if
you want complete control over what files to include.

See the [`.cleanmodules-default`](./cleanmodules-default) to see what patterns are included by
default by default.

#### `--keep-empty | -k`

`boolean`

Skips removing empty folders after removing files.

#### `--dry-run | -d`

`boolean`

Runs the script and prints the result without actually removing any files. Does not count the number
of removed empty directories.

#### `--json | -j`

`boolean`

Only logs a final JSON dump at the end of the script (useful for logs or services).

#### `--yes | -y`

`boolean`

Skips the confirmation prompt at the start of the script.

### `clean-modules analyze` üîé

Compiles a list of all files that would be included by `clean-modules` and gives a breakdown of:

- exact file path
- what glob patterns it was included by
- how the patterns were formatted and passed along to `picomatch`
- if the file was included by default

#### Usage

```bash
clean-modules analyze [options]
```

Because of the amount of data it can be useful to pipe it somewhere, like:

```bash
clean-modules analyze >> clean-modules-result.json
```

#### Options

The `analyze` command accepts several of the default command's options and applies them in the same
way:

- [`--include`]()
- [`--exclude`]()
- [`--directory`]()
- [`--glob-file`]()
- [`--no-defaults`]()

#### Example output

```json
[
  {
    "filePath": "/Users/me/projects/foo/node_modules/dependency/__tests__/test1.js",
    "includedByDefault": true,
    "includedByGlobs": [
      {
        "original": "__tests__/",
        "derived": "/Users/me/projects/foo/node_modules/dependency/**/__tests__/**"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Glob patterns and configuration file

clean-modules accepts globs from either a configuration file (`.clean-modules` next to
`node_modules` by default) or CLI arguments. It uses
[`.gitignore`-like](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore) glob patterns
that are converted to valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch) globs, which is
what is used to match file paths under the hood.

**Differences from regular ignore syntax:**

- To include a directory the pattern _must_ end with `/`, `/*` or `/**`
  - This is to prevent directories matching common file names from being included by the globs.
- Casing is ignored.

The same type of patterns are accepted by both the `--include`/`--exclude` arguments and the glob
configuration file.

**Like with .gitignore, globs should use forward-slashes as separators on all operative systems (including Windows)!**

### Example configuration file

```ignore
# this is a comment (starts with a #)

# to include include directories, end patterns with / or /* or /**
dep1/
dep1/*
dep2/**

# files are matched in any directory by default
**/*.test.js
# is the same as
*.test.js

# use a leading / to include a file or directory at a specific place
/dep4/this/specific/directory/**
/dep4/this/specific/file.js

# to exclude a path, prepend it with a !
!/not/this/directory/
!not-me.js

# to use leading exclamation marks without excluding, escape them
\!(*.d).ts
```

### Default globs

The default globs can be found in the [`.cleanmodules-default`](./.cleanmodules-default) file. It
only contains inclusions (as exclusions would override custom inclusions) and consists of a large
list of the most common files that are safe to remove.

That said, it's impossible to guarantee that none of the files are needed, and you might need to do
custom exclusions depending on what packages you use.

#### Common extra inclusions

- `**/*.d.ts`: **If you don't use TypeScript.** TypeScript declaration files take up a lot of space
  in your `node_modules` folder, but they are most likely required to build your application. Useful
  locally even if you don't use TypeScript since they can be parsed by your IDE.

#### Common extra exclusions

- `**/*.map.js`: **If you are running `clean-modules` locally or need source files in production.**
  `clean-modules` removes sourcemap files by default since they take up a lot of space and does not
  break builds when removed. They can be nice to have though, especially while developing.

## Alternatives

The most common issues I found with available tools are:

- They only allow inclusion/exclusion of file names, not file paths. This prevents you from e.g.
  excluding subdirectories of a specific folder, like `@types/react-native`.
- They include too many, or too few, patterns by default. Lots of them also include patterns like
  `*.ts` by default, which breaks TypeScript declaration files on build.
- They are too slow (only relevant when running on large projects)
- They are abandoned or don't respond to issues.
